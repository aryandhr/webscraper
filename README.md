Bot to fake attendance on iClicker

## Motivation

I did not want to attend CEM161

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x: The script requires Python 3.x to be installed on the system.
2. Selenium: The project utilizes the Selenium library, so users need to have it installed in their Python environment.
3. Web Drivers: Since Selenium interacts with web browsers, users need to have the appropriate web drivers installed for the browsers they wish to automate (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox).

## Disclaimer

The project is intended for educational and personal use only. This script was used ethically as the author diligently attended every lecture, a commitment exemplified by the attainment of a perfect 3.0 grade in the class. It is essential to underscore that this outstanding academic achievement would not have been conceivable without regular attendance, dedicated effort in studying, and earnest attention during the lectures.

## Acknowledgments

The author expresses their gratitude to the developers of the Selenium library and the open-source community for their valuable contributions.
